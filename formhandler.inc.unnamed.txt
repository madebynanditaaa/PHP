/*
all of these do the same thing with a slight variation.
1)require_once
2)require
//same as include.....but it will also give you an error.

3)include
includes a file like require, but it cannot find the file, it gives a warning saying it can't file that file.
4)include_once
does the same thing but it is also going to check if the file has already been included earlier inside the script and if yes(it has been included in the script earlier) it gives you a slight warning.
