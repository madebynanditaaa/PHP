default:
ON DELETE NO ACTION
error msg by default
if i delete something from the users table,
and that id wala data is used as reference in this table
there is a relation between these tables...
if i continue to delete....i will get an error.

ON DELETE CASCADE
if there is any tuple in child table which has reltionship with the deleted element in the parent table,
all tuples of the child table which have deleted foreign key references
will be deleted.


ON DELETE SET NULL
instead of deleting all the deleting foreign key id's it'll set it to null
